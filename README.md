##Problems not solved:
###1.different remoter has different code rules,for each of them,I should recode and define them,I just find one type,but I don't konw what kind of air-conditioner it could remote
###2.the code rules are owned by Supplier personally,there is not data on the Internet,so I don't realize the remoting...so sad.
